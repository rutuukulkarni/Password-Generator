# React + Vite
# My Project

This project is a Random Password Generator that allows users to create secure, customizable passwords. Users can choose the password length (up to 50 characters) and select which character types to include: numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters. The tool generates a random password based on these preferences, ensuring it meets the user's desired criteria for security.

## How It Works

npm create vite@latest
proj Name : Your Project Name
cd Your Project Name
npm i
npm run dev
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Tailwind

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
